# VPC and Subnets for GKE and Cloud SQL

This script configures a single simple VPC with subnets with secondary ranges inside of a project.

This VPC has three subnets, with the first subnet being given two secondary
ranges.

#Subtitution of values in .tfvars file 
we have to move to the config directory and we have make changes in .tfvars file 
Here we have production.tfvars and prod-backend.tfvars

<!-- Values for production.tfvars file -->
