# VPC and Subnets for GKE and Cloud SQL

This script configures a single simple VPC with subnets with secondary ranges inside of a project.

This VPC has three subnets, with the first subnet being given two secondary
ranges.

# Subtitution of values in .tfvars file 

we have to move to the config directory and we have make changes in .tfvars file 

Here we have production.tfvars and prod-backend.tfvars

<!-- Values for production.tfvars file -->
## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| network\_name | The name of the VPC network being created | string | n/a | yes |
| project\_id | The project ID to host the network in | string | n/a | yes |
| region | The region of the network in | string | n/a | yes |
| gke\_subnet | the name of gke subnet | string | n/a | yes |
| vm\_subnet | the name of vm subnet | string | n/a | yes |
| db\_subnet | the name of db subnet | string | n/a | yes |

| subnet02 | the subnet range of vm subnet | string | n/a | yes |
| subnet03 | the subnet range of db subnet | string | n/a | yes |
| pods\_cidr\_range | the pods cidr range | string | n/a | yes |
| services\_cidr\_range | the services cidr range | string | n/a | yes |
